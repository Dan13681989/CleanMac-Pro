# CleanMac-Pro
Network optimization and system cleanup tools for macOS.

## Usage:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/network_optimizer.sh
./scripts/system_cleanup.sh

🚀 Network Optimization Module

New Features Added:

Network Optimizer: TCP tuning, DNS optimization, latency reduction
System Cleanup: Cache clearing, disk space recovery
Performance Monitor: Real-time network status tracking
Quick Start:

bash
# Run network optimization
sudo ./scripts/network_optimizer.sh

# Run system cleanup
./scripts/system_cleanup.sh

# Monitor network
./scripts/network_monitor.sh
Performance Results:

94 Mbps download/upload (hardware maximum)
3.4ms local latency
0% packet loss
Professional-grade TCP optimization
Based on comprehensive optimization session:

All commands and configurations that achieved maximum network performance are documented in docs/network-optimization-guide.md

## 🚀 Network Optimization Module (New!)

### What's Included:
1. **Network Optimizer** (`scripts/network_optimizer.sh`) - Optimizes DNS, TCP parameters for maximum speed
2. **System Cleanup** (`scripts/system_cleanup.sh`) - Clears caches, downloads, and frees disk space
3. **Network Monitor** (`scripts/network_monitor.sh`) - Real-time network status and speed testing

### One-Click Setup:
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Dan13681989/CleanMac-Pro.git
cd CleanMac-Pro
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
sudo ./scripts/network_optimizer.sh
Proven Results:

✅ 94 Mbps download/upload (hardware maximum)
✅ 3.4ms local latency
✅ 0% packet loss
✅ Professional-grade TCP optimization
Maintenance:

bash
# Weekly: Clear DNS cache
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

# Monthly: Run cleanup
./scripts/system_cleanup.sh

# Monitor anytime:
./scripts/network_monitor.sh
Based on Real Optimization:

All scripts are based on actual optimization session documented on Dec 20, 2025, achieving maximum possible network performance.
