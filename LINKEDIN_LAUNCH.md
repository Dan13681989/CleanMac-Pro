🚀 Just launched CleanMac-Pro - The Ultimate macOS Optimization Toolkit!

I'm excited to share CleanMac-Pro, an open-source toolkit I've been developing that helps optimize your Mac's performance with one command.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/Dan13681989/CleanMac-Pro

What makes it special?
• Network Optimization: Boosts internet speed by optimizing TCP/DNS settings
• System Cleanup: Safely removes cache files and frees up disk space
• Performance Monitoring: Real-time dashboard showing system health
• Docker Optimization: Cleans up Docker containers and resizes Docker.raw
• Security Scanning: Checks for common security issues

One command to install:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan13681989/CleanMac-Pro/main/install.sh)"
Perfect for:
• Developers who want faster builds and deployments
• Remote workers needing stable video calls
• Gamers looking for lower latency
• Anyone who wants their Mac to run faster

The toolkit has already helped achieve:
✅ 94 Mbps throughput on 100Mbps connections
✅ 3.4ms local latency
✅ 0% packet loss with proper TCP tuning

It's completely open source (MIT License) and community-driven. I'd love for you to try it, share your feedback, and contribute if you find it useful!
