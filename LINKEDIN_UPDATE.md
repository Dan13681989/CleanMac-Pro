🚀 Excited to share my latest project: CleanMac Pro Enterprise!

I've developed a comprehensive macOS management suite from the ground up, featuring:

• 18 enterprise-grade tools in a professional control panel
• AI-powered system analytics and predictive maintenance
• Automated backup and security hardening systems
• One-line installation and professional documentation

This project showcases my skills in:
- Advanced bash scripting and system automation
- Full software development lifecycle
- User experience design and documentation
- Project architecture and deployment strategies

The tool is now live and open source - perfect for developers, IT professionals, and macOS power users.
